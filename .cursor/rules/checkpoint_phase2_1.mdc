# Checkpoint: Phase 2.1 Summary and Next Steps

**Completed (Phase 2.1)**

*   **In-Memory Storage (`raft-storage` crate):** Implemented `InMemoryStorage` in [`raft-storage/src/lib.rs`](mdc:raft-storage/src/lib.rs), providing a concrete, testable implementation of the `Storage` trait defined in `raft-core`.
*   **Unit Tests:** Developed and successfully passed a comprehensive suite of unit tests within [`raft-storage/src/lib.rs`](mdc:raft-storage/src/lib.rs) covering:
    *   Hard state read/write.
    *   Log entry append (single, multiple, overwrite, gap detection).
    *   Log entry read (single, range).
    *   Log truncation (prefix and suffix, including edge cases like empty log, truncation past boundaries, and absolute index handling).
    *   Last log index/term retrieval.
*   **Quality Standards:** Verified that `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo fmt --all`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass successfully, meeting the requirements outlined in [checkpoint-quality](mdc:.cursor/rules/checkpoint-quality.mdc).

Refer to [docs/PLAN.md](mdc:docs/PLAN.md) for details.

**Next focus (Phase 2.2)**

1.  **Mock Transport (`raft-transport` crate):** Implement a Tokio channelâ€“based transport to simulate RPCs between Raft nodes.
2.  **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for the mock transport to verify message delivery, ordering, and potentially simulate network partitions or delays (as specified in the plan).

Use this checkpoint to guide the implementation of the `raft-transport` crate.
