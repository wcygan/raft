# Project Goal: Learning Raft

The primary purpose of this project is to learn about the Raft consensus algorithm by building a simplified, working implementation in Rust using Tokio and gRPC.

A key focus is ensuring the implementation is correct and robust, which will be achieved through a comprehensive testing strategy including unit, integration, deterministic cluster, and end-to-end tests.

Refer to [docs/overview.md](mdc:docs/overview.md) for the high-level design and testing approach.
