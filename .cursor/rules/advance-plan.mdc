# Advance Implementation Plan

When a checkpoint rule (e.g., `checkpoint_phase1`) indicates that a specific phase of the project is complete, your next actions should focus on the **subsequent phase** described in the overall project plan.

1.  **Identify Completed Phase:** Note the phase marked as complete in the active checkpoint rule.
2.  **Consult the Plan:** Refer to the [docs/PLAN.md](mdc:docs/PLAN.md) document.
3.  **Target Next Phase:** Prioritize implementing the tasks and objectives outlined for the phase *immediately following* the one that was just completed.

For example, if the checkpoint confirms **Phase 1** is done, you must now focus on implementing **Phase 2** as detailed in [docs/PLAN.md](mdc:docs/PLAN.md).
