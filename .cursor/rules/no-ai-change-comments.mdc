# Avoid AI Change Comments

When modifying code, please do not add comments that merely describe the change you just made (e.g., `# Changed variable name`, `// Added error handling`). Assume the commit history and diff will document the specific changes.

Focus comments on *why* a particular design choice was made or explaining complex logic, not *what* was changed by the AI edit itself.
