# Checkpoint Quality Standards

Before marking any project phase or significant milestone as complete (i.e., reaching a checkpoint), the following conditions **MUST** be met:

1.  **Clean Check:** The command `cargo check --workspace` must complete successfully without any errors or warnings.
2.  **Formatted Code:** The command `cargo fmt --all` must report no changes needed.
3.  **Passing Tests:** The command `cargo test --workspace` must complete successfully, with all tests passing.

Any deviations from these standards (lint warnings, formatting issues, failing tests) must be addressed and fixed *before* the checkpoint is considered reached.
