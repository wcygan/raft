# Checkpoint: Phase 3 Summary and Next Steps

**Completed (Phase 3 - Leader Election)**

*   **State Machine & Transitions (`raft-core` crate):** Implemented the core Raft state transitions (Follower ↔ Candidate ↔ Leader) within [`raft-core/src/lib.rs`](mdc:raft-core/src/lib.rs).
*   **Election Timer:** Implemented election timer logic with randomized timeouts and correct reset behavior on state changes or relevant RPCs.
*   **RPC Handling:**
    *   Implemented `handle_request_vote` in [`raft-core/src/lib.rs`](mdc:raft-core/src/lib.rs) according to Raft rules (§5.1, §5.2, §5.4), including term checks, log up-to-date checks, and persistence of `HardState` (term, voted_for).
    *   Implemented `handle_election_timeout` to initiate candidacy, send `RequestVote` RPCs concurrently, tally votes, and transition to Leader upon achieving majority.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** Added specific logic to correctly handle leader election in single-node clusters.
*   **Unit Tests:** Developed and passed unit tests in [`raft-core/src/lib.rs`](mdc:raft-core/src/lib.rs) covering:
    *   State transitions (`become_follower`, `become_candidate`, `become_leader`).
    *   `handle_request_vote` scenarios (grant, reject term, reject log, reject voted, step down).
    *   `is_log_up_to_date` logic.
    *   Election timer reset behavior.
*   **Integration Tests:** Developed and passed integration tests in [`raft-core/tests/election_test.rs`](mdc:raft-core/tests/election_test.rs) using `MockTransport` to verify:
    *   Correct initial state.
    *   Successful leader election in a single-node cluster.
    *   Successful and stable leader election in a 3-node cluster.
    *   Resolved issues related to asynchronous task readiness and test setup using `setup_cluster` and `spawn_raft_responder_task` helpers.
*   **Quality Standards:** Verified that `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo fmt --all`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass successfully, meeting the requirements outlined in [checkpoint-quality](mdc:.cursor/rules/checkpoint-quality.mdc).

Refer to [docs/PLAN.md](mdc:docs/PLAN.md) for details.

**Next focus (Phase 4 - Log Replication & Commit)**

1.  **AppendEntries RPC Logic (`raft-core` crate):**
    *   Implement the leader logic to send `AppendEntries` RPCs (initially as heartbeats, later with log entries).
    *   Implement the follower logic in `handle_append_entries` to respond to these RPCs, including term checks, log consistency checks, and appending entries.
2.  **Commit Index Advancement:**
    *   Implement leader logic to update its `commit_index` based on `match_index` across a majority of followers.
    *   Implement follower logic to update its `commit_index` based on the `leader_commit` field in `AppendEntries` requests.
3.  **State Machine Application:** Apply committed log entries to the state machine (though the machine itself might still be trivial).
4.  **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for the log matching property and commit rule implementations.
5.  **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests using `MockTransport` to verify that:
    *   A leader sends periodic heartbeats.
    *   A leader replicates log entries to followers.
    *   The commit index advances correctly on the leader and followers.
6.  **Deterministic Cluster Tests:** Enhance or use a deterministic test harness to simulate follower lag, leader crashes during replication, and recovery scenarios involving log reconciliation.

Use this checkpoint to guide the implementation of the log replication and commit logic within the `raft-core` crate.
