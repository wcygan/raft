# Default Rule Settings

When creating new Cursor rules (`.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules`), ensure the `alwaysApply` field in the frontmatter metadata is set to `true` by default, unless there is a specific reason for the rule to be conditional.

Example:
```
---
description: "Description of the rule"
globs: ["*.rs"] # Optional glob patterns
alwaysApply: true # Default this to true
---

Rule content goes here...
```

This helps ensure that important project context and guidelines are consistently available to the AI assistant.
