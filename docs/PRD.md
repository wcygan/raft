# Project Requirements Document (PRD): Learning Raft

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a project focused on learning the Raft consensus algorithm by implementing it in Rust.

### 1.1 What is Raft?

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The goal of Raft is to manage a replicated log, ensuring that multiple servers agree on the same sequence of operations even in the presence of failures (excluding Byzantine failures). It achieves this through leader election, log replication, and safety mechanisms.

## 2. Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is **educational**: to gain a deep understanding of the Raft consensus algorithm by building a working implementation from scratch.

Key objectives include:

*   **Simplicity:** Focus on implementing the core Raft algorithm as described in the original paper. Avoid complex features or optimizations not essential to understanding the fundamental concepts (e.g., membership changes, log compaction beyond basic snapshotting if implemented).
*   **Correctness:** Prioritize a correct and robust implementation. This will be validated through comprehensive testing (unit, integration, deterministic cluster tests).
*   **Technology Stack:** Utilize modern Rust and the Tokio asynchronous runtime. Leverage gRPC for inter-node communication.
*   **Custom Write-Ahead Log (WAL):** Implement a simple Write-Ahead Log from scratch using Tokio's file system APIs to understand the persistence layer requirements of Raft.

## 3. Non-Goals

*   **Production-Ready System:** This implementation is for learning purposes and is not intended to be a feature-complete, highly optimized, or production-grade Raft library.
*   **Advanced Features:** Implementation of complex Raft extensions (e.g., dynamic membership changes, pre-vote protocol, leadership transfer) is outside the scope unless deemed simple and beneficial for core understanding.
*   **Performance Optimization:** While the implementation should be reasonably efficient, extreme performance tuning is not a primary objective.
